    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Bang Bang Chicken Burritos are a flavorful fusion dish featuring crispy, bite-sized chicken tossed in a creamy, spicy-sweet chili sauce. Wrapped in a large flour tortilla with fresh, crunchy coleslaw, the burritos are pan-seared in butter to create a perfectly toasted, golden-brown exterior.The result is a satisfying contrast of textures: a warm, crispy shell and hot chicken paired with the cool, refreshing crunch of the slaw.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cups mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sweet chili sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Sriracha</li>
        <li>12 frozen crispy chicken strips</li>
        <li>4 (10 to 12-inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>2 cups coleslaw mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir mayonnaise, chili sauce, and Sriracha sauce together in a small bowl until well combined and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare chicken strips in the air fryer according to package directions and cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Toss chicken with bang bang sauce until evenly coated. Divide chicken mixture among tortillas and place just below the center of each tortilla.</li>
        <li>Top evenly with slaw mix. Fold the sides slightly over the filling and roll the tortilla up from the bottom.</li>
        <li>Working in two batches if necessary, heat butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Place burritos, seam side down, in hot skillet and cook until toasted golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown and toasted, about 2 minutes more.</li>
